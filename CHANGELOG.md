## [Unreleased]

### Added

- An overload guard on the shared ENI. When workers send more packets than
  the owner's CPU forwards, so the NIC drops them at random, the owner drops
  a tenth of the worker traffic in an XDP program instead, before the kernel
  spends time on it. It always passes replies to its path probe, so the
  owner no longer hands over just because a flood filled its CPU. While it
  drops, the shared ENI's receive threads run at nice -10, and while it's
  attached the shared ENI's receive ring is at its largest size. It logs
  `overload guard engaged` and `overload guard cleared`, and
  `/var/lib/natpair/overload-guard-off` turns it off. The shared canary's
  TCP connections now take ports 61000 to 65535 on the shared address.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-09

### Changed

- New NATs' root volumes are encrypted with the account's default EBS key, AWS
  managed `aws/ebs` unless the account sets another. Running NATs keep their
  volumes until you replace them. The release binary is the same as 0.1.0, so
  pairs can move to the 0.1.1 module and keep `release = "v0.1.0"`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

### Added

- A highly available NAT for AWS: two Amazon Linux 2023 instances share one ENI
  and Elastic IP, and the standby takes the ENI over when the owner fails.
- A DynamoDB lease decides which NAT owns the ENI. A kernel fence stops a NAT
  from forwarding once its lease expires, even if the daemon is frozen or killed.
- conntrackd copies connection state to the standby, so open TCP connections
  survive a failover.
- Self-updating releases. Each pair is pinned to a release tag and the SHA-256
  of its tarball, and the NATs roll a new pin out one at a time.
- A Terraform module that deploys the whole pair into an existing VPC. You
  point your route tables at its `shared_eni_id` output, and the NATs forward
  traffic from every CIDR of the VPC unless you set `worker_cidrs`.
- Optional Datadog agent that ships natpair's logs and host metrics.

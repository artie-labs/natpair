## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A full connection table cut off the NAT's own traffic: under 3,000 new
  worker connections a second, the owner's DNS lookups failed and it stepped
  down. The NAT's own TCP connections, its UDP with the VPC and with Amazon
  Time Sync and the Route 53 Resolver, and the peer's copies now skip the
  connection table. The host firewall accepts their replies without state,
  only on the NAT's own ephemeral ports, with rate-limited ICMP errors. The
  own canary's probes now use ports 61000 to 65535. NATs log `the connection
  table is nearly full` at 90%. NATs set this up at boot, so pairs pick it
  up when they roll to a release with this fix.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-09

### Changed

- New NATs' root volumes are encrypted with the account's default EBS key, AWS
  managed `aws/ebs` unless the account sets another. Running NATs keep their
  volumes until you replace them. The release binary is the same as 0.1.0, so
  pairs can move to the 0.1.1 module and keep `release = "v0.1.0"`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

### Added

- A highly available NAT for AWS: two Amazon Linux 2023 instances share one ENI
  and Elastic IP, and the standby takes the ENI over when the owner fails.
- A DynamoDB lease decides which NAT owns the ENI. A kernel fence stops a NAT
  from forwarding once its lease expires, even if the daemon is frozen or killed.
- conntrackd copies connection state to the standby, so open TCP connections
  survive a failover.
- Self-updating releases. Each pair is pinned to a release tag and the SHA-256
  of its tarball, and the NATs roll a new pin out one at a time.
- A Terraform module that deploys the whole pair into an existing VPC. You
  point your route tables at its `shared_eni_id` output, and the NATs forward
  traffic from every CIDR of the VPC unless you set `worker_cidrs`.
- Optional Datadog agent that ships natpair's logs and host metrics.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

### Added

- A highly available NAT for AWS: two Amazon Linux 2023 instances share one ENI
  and Elastic IP, and the standby takes the ENI over when the owner fails.
- A DynamoDB lease decides which NAT owns the ENI. A kernel fence stops a NAT
  from forwarding once its lease expires, even if the daemon is frozen or killed.
- conntrackd copies connection state to the standby, so open TCP connections
  survive a failover.
- Self-updating releases. Each pair is pinned to a release tag and the SHA-256
  of its tarball, and the NATs roll a new pin out one at a time.
- A Terraform module that deploys the whole pair into an existing VPC. You
  point your route tables at its `shared_eni_id` output, and the NATs forward
  traffic from every CIDR of the VPC unless you set `worker_cidrs`.
- Optional Datadog agent that ships natpair's logs and host metrics.

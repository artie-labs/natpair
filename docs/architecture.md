# How natpair works

natpair is two NAT instances, A and B, in one public subnet. Private subnets
route their internet traffic to a third network interface, the **shared ENI**,
which carries the pair's Elastic IP. Whichever NAT holds the shared ENI
forwards. That NAT is the **owner**. The other is the **standby**.

The Terraform module in [`terraform/`](../terraform) creates all of it: both
NATs, the shared ENI and its Elastic IP association, the DynamoDB table, the
NATs' IAM role, the probe receiver and a DynamoDB gateway endpoint. You point
the private subnets' default routes at the shared ENI.

## Who owns the shared ENI: the lease

One DynamoDB item, the lease, records the owner.

- The owner renews the lease every 0.5 s with a conditional write. Each
  successful renewal lets it forward for the next 4 s.
- The standby may take the lease only after the item has stayed unchanged for
  6 s. Because 6 s is longer than 4 s, the old owner has always stopped
  forwarding before the standby starts.
- An owner that stops on purpose releases the lease, so the standby takes over
  on its next check instead of waiting 6 s.

## Stopping a NAT that can't renew: the fence

A small BPF program in the kernel checks every forwarded packet against the
end of the owner's current 4 s. After that, the kernel drops private-subnet
traffic, even if the natpair daemon has crashed, hung or been killed. So two
NATs never forward at the same time, and a frozen owner can't keep traffic
going to the wrong place.

## Keeping connections across a takeover: conntrackd

Each NAT runs conntrackd, which copies the owner's connection table to the
standby as connections open and close. When the standby takes over, it loads
those copies, so established TCP connections keep their source address and
port and carry on. Only TCP over IPv4 is copied.

A connection the new owner doesn't know gets a TCP reset instead of silence,
so the client reconnects at once rather than waiting for its own timeout.

## Checking the path: probes

The daemon checks that traffic actually gets out, not just that the instance
is up.

- **The owner** uploads 4 KiB over HTTPS through the shared Elastic IP every
  second. The probe receiver, a Lambda function URL that requires IAM
  authentication, sends the upload back, so large packets are tested in both
  directions.
- **The standby** checks its own path every 5 s through its own Elastic IP,
  and checks that its copy of the connection table holds the owner's recent
  probe connections and the owner's 16 oldest connections.
- Each NAT writes a short report to DynamoDB after every round, so the peer
  can see it.

An owner steps down after two failed rounds, but only once the standby has
proved its own path. So a failure that affects both, such as the receiver
being down, never makes a healthy owner step down. If the owner also crashes
during such a failure, the standby still takes over, about 2 s later than
usual.

## Taking over

When the standby takes the lease, it:

1. loads the copied connections,
2. moves the shared ENI to itself, forcing the detach after 15 s if the old
   owner doesn't let go,
3. checks an upload through the shared Elastic IP,
4. and only then opens its fence and starts forwarding.

## Upgrading itself

The pinned release lives in the same DynamoDB table. Every minute each NAT
compares it with the release it runs.

1. The standby downloads the pinned release, checks its SHA-256, installs it
   and reboots into it. It does this only while the owner serves with a
   working path.
2. Once the standby has run the new release and stayed ready for 2 minutes,
   the owner hands over, as in planned maintenance.
3. The old owner, now the standby, installs the release and reboots.

A release that never gets ready stays on the standby, so traffic stays on the
old release. See [operations](operations.md#upgrade) for the steps.

## Forwarding at full load

Linux processes received packets in softirq context, kernel work that the
scheduler doesn't manage like a process. How that work shares the CPU with the
daemon depends on the kernel:

- Linux 6.1 runs softirq work in the ksoftirqd threads once there is more than
  it can finish at once. The scheduler shares the CPU between those threads
  and the daemon, so a NAT whose forwarding fills the CPU still renews its
  lease.
- Linux 6.5 and later run pending softirq work in whatever task re-enables
  bottom halves, which the daemon does in many of its own system calls.
  Upstream made this change in commit
  [d15121be7485](https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/d15121be7485655129101f3960ae6add40204463)
  ("Revert "softirq: Let ksoftirqd do its job""), which names threaded NAPI
  as the way to keep receive work under the scheduler. On a c7gn.large on
  Linux 6.18 with both CPUs full of forwarding, 96.7% of the daemon's CPU
  samples were forwarding work. It used 31.5% of a CPU, and in a 60 s run its
  lease renewals timed out 11 times and its DNS lookups and probes 35 times.

NAPI is how Linux polls a network device's receive queues. So the daemon turns
on threaded NAPI (writes 1 to `/sys/class/net/<interface>/threaded`) for every
ENI: when it starts, right after the shared ENI comes up during a takeover,
and every 5 s, which also catches an ENI that wasn't up yet. Each receive
queue is then polled by a kernel thread named `napi/<interface>-<id>`, at the
default priority, and the scheduler shares the CPU between those threads and
the daemon as it did with ksoftirqd on 6.1. On the same 6.18 NAT and load with
threaded NAPI on, the daemon used about 1% of a CPU, with no lease or DNS
timeouts, and the NAT forwarded 4 to 6% less.

The daemon leaves interfaces without a device, such as `lo`, alone, and
leaves any value other than 0 in `threaded`, such as 2 for busy polling on
newer kernels. If something else writes 0, the daemon writes 1 again within
5 s.

## Network details

- Both NATs and the shared ENI must be in one availability zone, because an
  ENI can't move between zones.
- The NATs' security group allows all traffic from the VPC's CIDRs, and all
  TCP and UDP ports from anywhere. With every port open, AWS doesn't track
  connections through the NATs. That matters because after a takeover, the
  replies to copied connections arrive at the other instance, and AWS would
  drop replies it tracked on the old one.
- So the host firewall on each NAT is what filters traffic to the NAT itself.
  It accepts new connections only from the VPC and the peer, resets other TCP
  and drops everything else. Traffic the NAT forwards doesn't pass through it.
- The module adds a DynamoDB gateway endpoint to the public route table, so
  lease renewals and health reports reach DynamoDB without depending on the
  internet path the NATs forward. Workers' DynamoDB traffic goes through the
  NATs like their other traffic, so it leaves from the shared Elastic IP.
- By default the NATs forward traffic from every CIDR of the VPC. Their own
  traffic, such as AWS API calls and lease renewals, always keeps their own
  address and route, even though that address is inside the VPC.

## Security

- **Access.** The NATs run no SSH server. Open a shell with Session Manager.
  Instance metadata requires IMDSv2.
- **Permissions.** Each NAT's IAM role can change only its own pair's lease
  records and move only its own pair's shared ENI.
  [The module reference](../terraform/README.md#what-the-nats-may-do) lists
  every permission.
- **Receive threads.** The daemon turns on threaded NAPI for the ENIs, as in
  [Forwarding at full load](#forwarding-at-full-load). It needs no new
  permission: it already runs as root. The receive threads run at the
  default priority, so a flood of traffic to a NAT's own address competes for
  the CPU as an equal of forwarding, not ahead of it. The host firewall still
  drops it.
- **Connection copies.** conntrackd sends connection state to the peer in
  cleartext over UDP port 3780. The host firewall accepts it only from inside
  the VPC.
- **Encryption at rest.** The lease table uses DynamoDB's AWS owned key. The
  root volumes are encrypted with the account's default EBS key, AWS managed
  `aws/ebs` unless you've set another, so whoever launches the NATs needs
  permission to use that key through EC2.
- **Releases.** A NAT installs a release only if its SHA-256 matches
  `release_sha256`. Each release's files carry a GitHub build provenance
  attestation. To check one:

  ```sh
  gh attestation verify natpair_linux_arm64.tar.gz --repo artie-labs/natpair
  ```
